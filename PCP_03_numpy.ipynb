    "Python has several useful built-in packages as well as additional external packages. One such package is <a href='https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/'>NumPy</a>, which adds support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a number of mathematical functions to operate on these structures. This unit covers array objects as the most fundamental NumPy data structure along with important NumPy array operations. Furthermore, we discuss numerical types, methods for type conversion, and constants (including the constants `nan` and `inf`) offered by NumPy. The three exercises included at the end of this unit cover key aspects needed throughout the PCP notebooks. Therefore, we encourage students to work through these exercises carefully. In particular, we <a href='#recap_matrix'>recapitulate the mathematical concept of matrices and matrix multiplication</a>, before we cover these aspects in <a href='#exercise_matrix_operation'>Exercise 2</a> from an implementation perspective. We believe that understanding both&mdash;the mathematical formulation of abstract concepts and their realization in a programming context&mdash;is key in engineering education. This philosophy also forms the basis of the PCP notebooks to follow.       \n",

    "\n",
    "As said above, NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. In principle, one can also use the Python concept of lists to model an array. However, processing such lists is usually slow. Being mostly written in C or C++ and storing arrays at continuous places in memory (unlike lists), NumPy can process and compute with arrays in a very efficient way. This is the reason why NumPy is so powerful. In order to use NumPy, one needs to install the `numpy` package. This is what we already did when we created the [PCP Environment](PCP_01_getstarted.html), which contains a `numpy`-version. Furthermore, we need to use the Python `import` statement to get access to the NumPy functions. It is convenient to assign a short name to a frequently-used package (for example `np` in the case of `numpy`). This short name is used as a prefix when calling a function from the package. In the following code cell, we import `numpy` as `np`. To find out what the `numpy`-module contains, we use the Python command `dir(np)` to return a list all properties and methods of the specified module."
