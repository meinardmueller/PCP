    "In technical fields such as engineering or computer science, a <strong>signal</strong> may be defined as a function that conveys information about the state or behavior of a physical system. For example, a signal may describe the time-varying sound pressure at some place, the motion of a particle through some space, the distribution of light on a screen representing an image, or the sequence of images as in the case of a video signal. In this unit, we consider the case of sound or audio signals, which may be represented graphically by a plot that shows the relative air pressure (with respect to a reference air pressure) over time. In some way, a sinusoid of a given frequency may be thought of as a prototype of an audio signal. We start this unit by formally defining a signal as a mathematical function. Interleaving theory with practice, we then provide a Python function to generate a sinusoid with different parameters (duration, amplitude, frequency, phase, sampling rate), which you can look at via a plot and listen to via audio playback. To digitally compute with signals, one typically needs to convert a signal given on a continuous-time axis into one given on a discrete-time axis&mdash;a process commonly referred to as <strong>sampling</strong>. While providing a Python function that performs some equidistant sampling, we also discuss the kind of information that may be lost in the sampling process. This leads us to topics related to <strong>aliasing</strong> and the <strong>sampling theorem</strong>. Finally, using sinusoidal signals as an example, we cover the phenomena of constructive and destructive <strong>interference</strong>. In the exercises, we further deepen these aspects by studying the phenomenon known as <strong>beating</strong> and by looking at further examples illustrating aliasing. We assume that you are familiar with these fundamental concepts that are typically taught in an introductory signal processing course. Besides reviewing these concepts, another main learning objective of this unit is to show you how to generate and use multimedia objects (e.g., audio, image, and video objects) within the Jupyter notebook framework. In particular, in fields such as multimedia engineering, the interaction with concrete multimedia objects (e.g., sound examples) will help you move from recalling and reciting theoretical concepts towards comprehension and application. Following similar educational considerations, you may find additional material in the <a href=\"https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/FMP\">FMP Notebooks</a> for teaching and learning fundamentals of music processing. In particular, the <a href=\"https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/FMP/C2/C2S2_DigitalSignalSampling.html\">FMP Notebook on Sampling</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/FMP/C2/C2S3_InterferenceBeating.html\">FMP Notebook on Interference and Beating</a> have served as basis for this unit. \n",

    "A **sound** is generated by a vibrating object such as the vocal cords of a singer, the string and soundboard of a violin, or the diaphragm of a kettledrum. In signal processing, such a sound is typically represented by a function or **signal** $f\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$, which encodes the sound's air pressure changes over time. The signal is called **periodic** if its values repeat at regular intervals. Intuitively speaking, the **period** of the signal is defined as the time required to complete a cycle. The **frequency**, measured in **Hertz** (Hz), is the reciprocal of the period. The prototype of such a periodic signal is a **sinusoid**, which is specified by its **frequency**, its **amplitude** (the peak deviation of the sinusoid from its mean), and its **phase** (determining where in its cycle the sinusoid is at time zero). In the following code cell, we provide a function for generating a sinusoid. "

    "In general, sampling is a **lossy** operation in the sense that information is lost in this process and that the original CT-signal cannot be recovered from its sampled version. Only if the CT-signal has additional properties in terms of its frequency spectrum (it needs to be **bandlimited**), a perfect reconstruction is possible. This is the assertion of the famous **sampling theorem**. The sampling theorem also shows how the original CT-signal can be reconstructed by superimposing suitably shifted $\\mathrm{sinc}$-functions weighted by the samples of the DT-signal.\n",

    "The <strong>sampling theorem</strong>, which is often associated with the names Harry Nyquist and Claude Shannon, states that a continuous-time (CT) signal that is bandlimited can be reconstructed perfectly under certain conditions. More precisely, a CT-signal $f\\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ is called <strong>$\\Omega$-bandlimited</strong> if the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ vanishes for $|\\omega|>\\Omega$ (i.e., $\\hat{f}(\\omega) = 0$ for $|\\omega|>\\Omega$). Let $f\\in L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ be an $\\Omega$-bandlimited function and let $x$ be the $T$-sampled version of $f$ with $T:=1/(2\\Omega)$ (i.e., $x(n)=f(nT)$, $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$). Then $f$ can be reconstructed from $x$ by\n",

    "Without additional properties, sampling may cause an effect known as **aliasing** where certain frequency components of the signal become indistinguishable. This effect is illustrated by the following figure. Using a high sampling rate, the original CT-signal can be reconstructed with high accuracy. However, when decreasing the sampling rate, the higher-frequency components are not captured well and only a coarse approximation of the original signal remains. This phenomenon is demonstrated by the following example."
