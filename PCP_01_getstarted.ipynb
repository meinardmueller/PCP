If a static view of the PCP notebooks is enough for you, the <a href=\"https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/PCP\">exported HTML versions</a> can be used right away without any installation. Suppose you want to execute, modify, and experiment with the Python code contained in the notebooks' code cells. In that case, you need to install Python, some additional Python packages, and the Jupyter software underlying the web-based interactive computational environment for creating notebook documents. In the following, we discuss the required software components and explain the steps necessary to install them. \n",
